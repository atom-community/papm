# papm

This is a template for atom-ide-community packages using TypeScript.

It is recommended to use the TypeScript template, but there is a JavaScript version too [here](https://github.com/atom-ide-community/papm-js).

Use `Ctrl+Shift+F` and replace `papm` with `atom-ide-packagename`. Then put your name in the license section and author section.
